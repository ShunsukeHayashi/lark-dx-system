# Lark DX System Design Project

A comprehensive Lark Base system design and implementation project for DX (Digital Transformation) consulting management.

## Overview

This repository contains the design specifications and implementation framework for building a complete DX consulting management system using Lark Base platform. The project follows a Log-Driven Development (LDD) approach with a structured command stack implementation.

## Key Features

- **Customer Management**: Track and manage DX consulting clients
- **Project Tracking**: Monitor consulting projects from initial consultation to completion
- **Task Management**: Detailed task tracking with priority and status management
- **Effect Measurement**: Quantitative tracking of DX implementation results
- **Workflow Automation**: Automated alerts, approvals, and status updates

## Implementation Status

The system is designed for:
- 10-50 users (consultants, support staff, managers)
- 100+ client companies (growing at 10 companies/month)
- 200-500 monthly transactions

## Development Approach

This project uses a unique **Command Stack Implementation (C1-C10)** approach where each command represents a complete implementation phase:

- C1: System Structure Analysis & Design
- C2: Field Design & Implementation
- C3: Relationship Building
- C4: Workflow Implementation
- C5: Button Implementation
- C6: View Creation
- C7: Dashboard Construction
- C8: Permission Settings
- C9: Testing & Validation
- C10: Deployment & Migration
